""" This file allows multiple jobs to be run on a server. 
    After each job, an email is sent to notify desired people 
    of its completion.

    Must specify a text job file that contains the names and 
    commands for each job. Each job has 4 lines, containing:
    1) the name, 2) the command, 3) the location of a file where
    the job output should be saved, 4) a blank line.

    An example job file format is as follows:

        Job1
        python job.py path1 arg1
        path/output1.txt

        Job2
        python job.py path2 arg2
        path/output2.txt

    Usage: python run_jobs.py jobs.txt
